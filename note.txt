	Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and portable environments that package software and its dependencies, enabling applications to run consistently across different computing environments. Docker simplifies the process of managing and deploying applications.
	Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to use a YAML file to configure the services, networks, and volumes required for your application, making it easy to define and manage complex multi-container applications with a single command.
